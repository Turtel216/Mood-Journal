<h1 id="subject1"> What is Mood Journal? </h1>
<p> Mood Journal is a Journaling Web application with some special features. It allows the user to write about their day in a classic diary format and then let the application know what their mood on that day was. After a specific number of entries the application analyses the text, and in combination with the mood level provided by the user for each entry, it draws a connection between specific words/phrases and a mood level. </p>
